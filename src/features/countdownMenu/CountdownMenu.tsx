/**
 * This dropdown menu should opens up a dropdown with 3 options:
 * - Start/pause the countdown.
 * - Reset the countdown to the default number.
 * - Double the current countdown.
 * 
 * It should have all the features of a basic dropdown & allow user to interact meaningfully with the countdown counter.
 * 
 * **BONUS POINT 🙌**: Add an input in the dropdown that allows user to set the counter to whatever number they want.
