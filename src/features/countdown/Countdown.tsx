/**
 * Counter is an example of a simple business logic of a click-up counter.
 * ```
 * Click > increments counter.
 * ```
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Make the counter countdown from 30s by default.
 * - The countdown starts/pauses on click.
 * - Persist the current count in local so that it stays after refreshes.
 * - Redesign it in a user-friendly way so that it can reset when paused/finished.
 *
 * **BONUS POINT 🎁**: Make this default countdown customisable.
 *
 * **BONUS BONUS POINT 🏎**: Add a little animation for the count down, to your liking.
