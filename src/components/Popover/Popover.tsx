/**
 * Popover is a component display a *popper*, a small piece of info, when a user clicks or taps on what usually is a button.
 *
 * Let's make one that uses the Extendable as an atom ⚛️.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - It must have all the functionalities of an Extendable
 * - It must be positioned **NEXT** to the triggering element, and the positioning could be customised.
 * - It must be mounted/unmounted from DOM completely instead of being visually hidden.
 * - Clicking/tapping on the trigger displays the popover.
 * - Clicking anywhere *outside* the popover closes it.
 * - It could be used standalone or controlled (*with/without external useState()*).
 * - The default trigger is a NstButton.
 *
 * **BONUS POINT 🎨**: Add a little transition where it fades in & out, and expand & shrink on mount/unmount (both from 90% -> 100%).
 *
 * **BONUS BONUS POINT 🦮**: Make it WCAG compliant.
 * > Good place to start: https://yale-a11y.gitlab.io/ui-component-library/tooltips-popovers
 *
 * Hint if you are not a11y-familiar: focus management is important to accessible users.
