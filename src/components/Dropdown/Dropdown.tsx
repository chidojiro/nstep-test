/**
 * Dropdown presents a list of items that users can choose to trigger a specific action with.
 * It is an organism that should be built on top of Popover as a molecule 🧱.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - It must have all the functionalities of a Popover
 * - It must display a list of similarly-designed items, with each item individually capable of triggering
 * at least its own `onClick` independently
 * - Clicking/tapping on the item closes the dropdown automatically, but make this feature turn-off-able.
 *
 * **BONUS POINT 🍓**: Add a way to make multi-level dropdown, where a dropdown item also shows a dropdown on hover.
 *
 * **BONUS BONUS POINT 🥑**: Make it WCAG compliant.
 * > Good place to start: https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/web/components-examples/dropdown-menu/
